Provide a means for grouping potential causes of risk. Several approaches can be  used, for example, a structure based on project objectives by category. A risk breakdown structure (RBS)  helps the project team to look at many sources from which project risk may arise in a risk identification  exercise. Different RBS structures will be appropriate for different types of projects. An organization can  use a previously prepared custom categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of  categories or may be structured into an RBS. The RBS is a hierarchical representation of risks according  to their risk categories. An example is shown in Figure 11-4. Beta Distribution Triangular Distribution 0.1 0.1 11 0.0 0.0 Beta and triangular distributions are frequently used in quantitative risk analysis. The data shown in the figure  on the left (Beta Distribution) is one example of a family of such distributions determined by two \"shape  parameters\". Other commonly used distributions include the uniform, normal and lognormal. In these charts  the horizontal (X) axes represent possible values of time or cost and the vertical (Y) axes represent relative  likelihood.  Figure 11-4. Example of a risk Breakdown Structure (rBS) \u2022\t  definitions of risk probability and impact. The quality and credibility of the risk analysis requires that  different levels of risk probability and impact be defined that are specific to the project context. General  definitions of probability levels and impact levels are tailored to the individual project during the Plan  Risk Management process for use in subsequent processes. Table 11-1 is an example of definitions of  negative impacts that could be used in evaluating risk impacts related to four project objectives.

Such assessments reflect the risk attitude of the project  team and other stakeholders. Effective assessment therefore requires explicit identification and management  of the risk approaches of key participants in the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. Where these risk  approaches introduce bias into the assessment of identified risks, attention should be paid to identifying bias  and correcting for it. Establishing definitions of the levels of probability and impact can reduce the influence of bias. The time  criticality of risk-related actions may magnify the importance of a risk. An evaluation of the quality of the  available information on project risks also helps to clarify the assessment of the risk\u2019s importance to the project. Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis is usually a rapid and cost-effective means of establishing priorities for Plan  Risk Responses and lays the foundation for Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, if required. The Perform Qualitative  Risk Analysis process is performed regularly throughout the project life cycle, as defined in the project\u2019s risk  management plan.

Continuous probability distributions, which are used extensively in modeling  and simulation, represent the uncertainty in values such as durations of schedule activities and costs  of project components. Discrete distributions can be used to represent uncertain events, such as the  outcome of a test or a possible scenario in a decision tree. Two examples of widely used continuous  distributions are shown in Figure 11-14. These distributions depict shapes that are compatible with the  data typically developed during the quantitative risk analysis.

Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which risks have the most potential  impact on the project. It helps to understand how the variations in project\u2019s objectives correlate with  variations in different uncertainties. Conversely, it examines the extent to which the uncertainty of  each project element affects the objective being studied when all other uncertain elements are held at  their baseline values. One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram (Figure 11-15),  which is useful for comparing relative importance and impact of variables that have a high degree of  uncertainty to those that are more stable. The Tornado diagram is also helpful in analyzing risk-taking  scenarios enabled on specific risks whose quantitative analysis highlights possible benefits greater  than corresponding identified negative impacts. A tornado diagram is a special type of bar chart used  in sensitivity analysis for comparing the relative importance of the variables. In a tornado diagram,  the Y-axis contains each type of uncertainty at base values, and the X-axis contains the spread or  correlation of the uncertainty to the studied output.

Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical concept  that calculates the average outcome when the future includes scenarios that may or may not happen  (i.e., analysis under uncertainty). The EMV of opportunities are generally expressed as positive values,  while those of threats are expressed as negative values. EMV requires a risk-neutral assumption\u2014 neither risk averse nor risk seeking. EMV for a project is calculated by multiplying the value of each  possible outcome by its probability of occurrence and adding the products together. A common use of  this type of analysis is a decision tree analysis (Figure 11-16).

Note 2: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M US to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M US   to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a   \u201cchance node\u201d) must be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant   but only $120M US for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of   each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see   shaded areas) to determine the overall Expected Monetary Value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for   the investment costs.

A project simulation uses a model that translates the specified detailed  uncertainties of the project into their potential impact on project objectives. Simulations are typically  performed using the Monte Carlo technique. In a simulation, the project model is computed many times  (iterated), with the input values (e.g., cost estimates or activity durations) chosen at random for each  iteration from the probability distributions of these variables. A histogram (e.g., total cost or completion  date) is calculated from the iterations. For a cost risk analysis, a simulation uses cost estimates. For a  schedule risk analysis, the schedule network diagram and duration estimates are used. The output from a  cost risk simulation using the three-element model and risk ranges is shown in Figure 11-17. It illustrates  the respective probability of achieving specific cost targets. Similar curves can be developed for other  project objectives.

If a conservative organization wants  a 75% likelihood of success, a budget of $50 million (a contingency of nearly 22 % ($50M - $41M)/$41M)) is required.

Each risk  response requires an understanding of the mechanism by which it will address the risk. This is the mechanism  used to analyze if the risk response plan is having the desired effect. It includes the identification and assignment  of one person (an owner for risk response) to take responsibility for each agreed-to and funded risk response. Risk  responses should be appropriate for the significance of the risk, cost-effective in meeting the challenge, realistic  within the project context, agreed upon by all parties involved, and owned by a responsible person. Selecting the  optimum risk response from several options is often required. The Plan Risk Responses process presents commonly used approaches to planning responses to the risks.  Risks include threats and opportunities that can affect project success, and responses are discussed for each. 11.5.1 Plan risk responses: Inputs ", "No section"]}}, "Plan risk responses": {"inputs": {"11.5.1.1 risk Management Plan": ["11.5.1.1 risk Management Plan Important components of the risk management plan include roles and responsibilities, risk analysis definitions,  11 timing for reviews (and for eliminating risks from review), and risk thresholds for low, moderate, and high risks.

The strategy or mix of strategies most likely to be effective  should be selected for each risk. Risk analysis tools, such as decision tree analysis (Section 11.4.2.2), can be  used to choose the most appropriate responses. Specific actions are developed to implement that strategy,  including primary and backup strategies, as necessary. A fallback plan can be developed for implementation  if the selected strategy turns out not to be fully effective or if an accepted risk occurs. Secondary risks should  also be reviewed. Secondary risks are risks that arise as a direct result of implementing a risk response. A  contingency reserve is often allocated for time or cost. If developed, it may include identification of the conditions  that trigger its use. \u00a92013 Project Management Institute.

The fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats  as well as positive risks or opportunities. Each of these risk response strategies have varied and unique influence  on the risk condition. These strategies should be chosen to match the risk\u2019s probability and impact on the project\u2019s  overall objectives. Avoidance and mitigation strategies are usually good strategies for critical risks with high impact,  while transference and acceptance are usually good strategies for threats that are less critical and with low overall  impact. The four strategies for dealing with negative risks or threats are further described as follows: \u2022\t  Avoid. Risk avoidance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to eliminate the threat or  protect the project from its impact. It usually involves changing the project management plan to eliminate  the threat entirely. The project manager may also isolate the project objectives from the risk\u2019s impact or  change the objective that is in jeopardy. Examples of this include extending the schedule, changing the  strategy, or reducing scope. The most radical avoidance strategy is to shut down the project entirely.  Some risks that arise early in the project can be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information,  improving communication, or acquiring expertise. \u2022\t  transfer. Risk transference is a risk response strategy whereby the project team shifts the impact of  a threat to a third party, together with ownership of the response. Transferring the risk simply gives  another party responsibility for its management\u2014it does not eliminate it. Transferring does not mean  disowning the risk by transferring it to a later project or another person without his or her knowledge or  agreement. Risk transference nearly always involves payment of a risk premium to the party taking on  the risk. Transferring liability for risk is most effective in dealing with financial risk exposure. Transference  tools can be quite diverse and include, but are not limited to, the use of insurance, performance bonds,  warranties, guarantees, etc. Contracts or agreements may be used to transfer liability for specified risks  to another party. For example, when a buyer has capabilities that the seller does not possess, it may be  prudent to transfer some work and its concurrent risk contractually back to the buyer. In many cases, use  of a cost-plus contract may transfer the cost risk to the buyer, while a fixed-price contract may transfer  risk to the seller. 344 \u00a92013 Project Management Institute.

Risk mitigation is a risk response strategy whereby the project team acts to reduce the  probability of occurrence or impact of a risk. It implies a reduction in the probability and/or impact of an  adverse risk to be within acceptable threshold limits. Taking early action to reduce the probability and/or  impact of a risk occurring on the project is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the  risk has occurred. Adopting less complex processes, conducting more tests, or choosing a more stable  supplier are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may require prototype development to reduce the  risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce  probability, a mitigation response might address the risk impact by targeting linkages that determine the  severity. For example, designing redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the  original component. \u2022\t  Accept. Risk acceptance is a risk response strategy whereby the project team decides to acknowledge  the risk and not take any action unless the risk occurs. This strategy is adopted where it is not possible  or cost-effective to address a specific risk in any other way. This strategy indicates that the project  team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk, or is unable to identify  any other suitable response strategy. This strategy can be either passive or active. Passive acceptance  requires no action except to document the strategy, leaving the project team to deal with the risks as  11 they occur, and to periodically review the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. The  most common active acceptance strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of  time, money, or resources to handle the risks.

The fourth strategy, accept, can be used for negative risks or threats as well as positive risks or opportunities. These  strategies, described below, are to exploit, share, enhance, and accept. \u2022\t  Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for risks with positive impacts where the organization wishes  to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with  a particular upside risk by ensuring the opportunity definitely happens. Examples of directly exploiting  responses include assigning an organization\u2019s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time  to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration required to  realize project objectives. \u00a92013 Project Management Institute.

The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or the positive impacts of an  opportunity. Identifying and maximizing key drivers of these positive-impact risks may increase the  probability of their occurrence. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding more resources to  an activity to finish early. \u2022\t  Share. Sharing a positive risk involves allocating some or all of the ownership of the opportunity to a  third party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit of the project. Examples of sharing  actions include forming risk-sharing partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures,  which can be established with the express purpose of taking advantage of the opportunity so that all  parties gain from their actions. \u2022\t  Accept.

For the  purposes of controlling risks, trends in the project\u2019s execution should be reviewed using performance information.  Earned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall  project performance. Outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion  from cost and schedule targets. Deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or  opportunities.

It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical  performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures  may include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation, such as  demonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success  in achieving the project\u2019s scope.
